# wordplay
wordplay is a Mastodon bot that generates rhyming jokes similar to this:

> What do you call a standard disobedience?
> A regulation insubordination!

It uses my natural language generation library [verbly](https://github.com/hatkirby/verbly) to pick words, [YAMLcpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp) to read a configuration file, and [mastodonpp](https://schlomp.space/tastytea/mastodonpp) to send the status updates to Mastodon.

The canonical wordplay handle is [@eventhenotion@beppo.online](https://beppo.online/@eventhenotion).
